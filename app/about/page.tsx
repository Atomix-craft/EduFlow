                After years of working with universities struggling with outdated, fragmented systems, 
                we saw the need for a unified platform that could handle every aspect of campus management.

              <p className="text-gray-600">
                CampusHub was born from our vision of a world where technology seamlessly supports 
                education, where administrators can focus on strategy rather than paperwork, and where 
                students have access to everything they need in one place.
